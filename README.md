# shatner-bot

## Introduction

The _package.json_ file within this repo can be used as a descriptor in [Hipchat](https://www.hipchat.com/) for the "Shatner" service, which uses the [shatner.pics](http://shatner.pics/) to return JPEG images of William Shatner, one of the greatest and most expressional actors ever, based on the _mood_ parameter provided by in the request.

## How does it work?

In Hipchat, the user gains access to the _/shatner_ command in a room that has this plugin enabled, for example if the user types _/shatner awesome_ the following image is loaded into th Hipchat room:

The idea is that users of the Hipchat room can use "Shatners" to express their present mood, just for fun :-)
